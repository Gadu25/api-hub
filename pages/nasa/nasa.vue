          What excites the Heart Nebula? First, the large emission nebula on
          the upper left, catalogued as IC 1805, looks somewhat like a human
          heart. The nebula glows brightly in red light emitted by its most
          prominent element, hydrogen, but this long-exposure image was also
          blended with light emitted by sulfur (yellow) and oxygen (blue). In
          the center of the Heart Nebula are young stars from the open star
          cluster Melotte 15 that are eroding away several picturesque dust
          pillars with their atom-exciting energetic light and winds. The
          Heart Nebula is located about 7,500 light years away toward the
          constellation of Cassiopeia. This wide field image shows much more,
          though, including the Fishhead Nebula just below the Heart, a
          supernova remnant on the lower left, and three planetary nebulas on
          the image right. Taken over 57 nights, this image is so deep,
          though, that it clearly shows fainter long and complex filaments.
